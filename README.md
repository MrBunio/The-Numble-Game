# The Numble Game

This is my own project that I worked on for hours. Numble is a variation of Wordle, but with numbers.
I made this project open source so that other people can learn from the code. If you plan to copy/rewrite my code, please credit me :). Stay tuned for updates!
And no, I won't clean up my code, BENSA.
